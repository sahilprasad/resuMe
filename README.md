# ResuMe 
A web application that streamlines that process of resume building.

## Why ##
Making the perfect resume is more often than not a very tedious task. Not only does one need to consider the content of the resume, but also the appearance--how does it come across to the potential employer? Will they think that the format should be more professional? 

We found ourselves taking hours to craft our own resumes, and realized that the design should be the last thing that you have to worry about. So, we decided to develop resuMe--a solution that would entirely separate the design aspect of a resume from the actual content. We believe that allowing individuals to focus on just the content would allow them to better represent themselves, without needing to bother with annoying margins that don't seem to line up.
